  prologue: |
    The urge to open the box overcame her. Horrible things flew out of the box including greed, envy, hatred,
    pain, disease, hunger, poverty, war, and death. All of life’s miseries had been let out into the world.
    She slammed the lid of the box back down. The last thing remaining inside of the box was hope.
    Ever since, humans have been able to hold onto this hope in order to survive the wickedness that she had let out.
  Greed: >
    Greed is not a defect in the gold that is desired but in the man who loves it
    — St. Augustine
  Envy: >
    It is in the character of very few men to honor without envy a friend who has prospered
    — Aeschylus
  Hatred: >
    Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love; this is the eternal rule
    — Buddha
  Pain: >
    Pain is temporary. It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year,
    but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place.
    If I quit, however, it lasts forever
    — Lance Armstrong
